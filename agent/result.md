# DevOrchestrator Self-Hosting Result Log

Self-hosting baseline established:
- stable controller remains in the original worktree;
- isolated development worktree created on `feature/self-hosted-dev`;
- no Worker may mutate or restart the stable controller directly.

D1 Self-Hosted DevOrchestrator Integration:
- Broker-native running state projection:
  - Added `project_runtime_status` in `src/dev_orchestrator/core/project_status.py` overlaying active broker worker runs (from `transition-executor.json`), reviews (from `ai-reviewer.json`), and plans (from `ai-planner.json`) onto project snapshots.
  - Updated `write_execution_status` and `write_review_status` to persist `broker_execution` and active `EXECUTING` / `REVIEWING` statuses in `.devorch/status.json`.
  - Updated `overlay_managed_runs` in `TransitionExecutor` to project `broker_execution` and `engine="aibroker"` on snapshots.
  - Updated CLI `project-status` to display the projected runtime status instead of stale `READY_TO_RUN`.
  - Updated `src/dev_orchestrator/config.py` to recognize `ai_roles.planner.enabled` as orchestration-ready.
- Transport-only Progress Channel:
  - Implemented `ProgressChannel` in `src/dev_orchestrator/core/progress.py` emitting milestone notifications: `PLAN_STARTED`, `PLAN_ACCEPTED`, `WORKER_STARTED`, `WORKER_DONE`, `TEST_FAILED`, `REVIEW_STARTED`, `REMEDIATE`, `REVIEW_ACCEPTED`, `OWNER_GATE`, `BLOCKED`, `TASK_COMPLETE`, `NEXT_TASK`.
  - Configurable notification levels: `quiet`, `normal` (default), `verbose`.
  - Added deduplication, rate-limiting, and restart-safe idempotency via `runtime/progress-channel.json`.
  - Isolated progress transport: `BrowserBridgeStore.submit_progress` and `claim_progress` routing through `runtime/bridge/progress/<adapter>/<binding_id>.jsonl` completely distinct from decision queues (`runtime/bridge/queues/`). Never triggers model inference and consumes zero AIBroker quota.
  - Bridge HTTP `/v1/progress` GET and POST endpoints added in `BridgeHTTPServer`.
  - Wired `ProgressChannel` into `TransitionExecutor`, `AIReviewerCoordinator`, `AIPlannerCoordinator`, `ControlCommandCoordinator`, and `daemon.py`.
  - Browser adapter `browser/chatgpt-web-adapter.user.js` polls `/v1/progress` and displays progress toasts without submitting turns to ChatGPT composer.
- Verification:
  - 202 unit tests passing cleanly (`python -m unittest discover -s tests_py`).
  - `node --check browser/chatgpt-web-adapter.user.js` passing.
  - `git diff --check` clean.
